# GitHashingExercise
The srcipt hash_script.sh takes as argument a 4-digit integer number and then uses a the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to create a 256-bit hash value.
This hash value is then printed and saved in hash_output.txt.
In case an argument is not provided, the script takes a default value as input (0819).
